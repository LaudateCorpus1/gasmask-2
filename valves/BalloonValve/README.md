# Balloon Valve

This valve was originally designed by @sophmur for respirator and cloth mask use and posted to [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4753245).

We have reworked the design into a NATO 40mm package for our use with this project. The assembly is very similar to the `FullyPrinterValve` since we reused much of the design.

Between the two pieces you should place a circular piece of a latex glove type material (thin, light, non-breathable). We are still working on a full assembly guide but for now we recommend marking the shape and size of the `BalloonValve-Inlet` and using scissors, you can also use a sharp knife if you find that easier.

As for assembly, if you find it difficult to stretch out the latex properly, you can put the `BalloonValve-Inlet` piece up against a vacuum cleaner to hold the membrane stretched out and then put on the `BalloonValve-Body` piece onto it. It should snap right together.
