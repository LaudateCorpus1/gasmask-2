# Valves
Due to the potentially large volume of filter canisters, a one way exhale valve is required to ensure a flow of fresh air and to reduce the chance of asphyxiation. Every mask in this repository should have space for an exhale valve. Refer to the documentation accompanying the mask for placement instructions.

## Variations

| Valve | Description | Print Time | Status |
| - | - | - | - |
| FullyPrintedValve | Requires no extra parts. Not a perfect seal but useful if resources are limited. Can be augmented to provide an excellent seal. | ~2h | Tested |
| BalloonValve | Requires a latex glove or thin balloon. Better if your craft skills are superior to your printer tune. | ~2h | Experimental |
