# BottleFilterAdapter

This component allows using water bottles / carbonated soft drink bottles to build homemade filters.

## Overview

There are 2 common standards for plastic bottles - PCO-1810 and PCO-1881. The first is the older standard, and the second is the newer standard with a lower profile and less material.

Currently this design only works with PCO-1810, a PCO-1881 variant may be added later.

## Building

### Materials

1. The printed adapter
2. A plastic water bottle or soft drink bottle
3. Glue / epoxy suitable for plastics (Optional)

### Print Parameters

* Print Time: Approximately 1 hour 30 minutes
* Nozzle Size: 0.4mm
* Layer Height: 0.2mm
* Infill: 15%
* Supports: On or Buildplate Only
* Walls: 2

### Assembly

1. Print the adapter in the default orientation - with the knob on the print surface.
2. Carefully remove all the support material from the bottle threads.
3. Add glue to the bottle and adapter bottle threads. (Optional)
