These are bits and pieces we used in building the mask and accessories!

## NATO 40mm Thread
This pair of thread models was designed based on the NATO 40mm specification for respiratory devices. It is also known as STANAG 4155, EN 148-1, or Rd 40x1/7". These models are provided to assist with the creation of masks, filter canisters, exhale valves, etc. that are compatible with other components in this repository.

These components were designed using information from this [EN-148-1 document](https://web.archive.org/web/20210329023351/https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/60082/4152181d809d48b2968c8c22062d4d21/SIST-EN-148-1-2019.pdf).

### Male
The male thread is designed to 20mm in length in order to meet the minimum requirement of 14.5mm per the specification. This helps ensure that it will reach the back of the female thread and press against the gasket to form an airtight seal. The top of the male thread model (positive Z) is chamfered for easier alignment when attaching components together. The bottom of the male thread (resting on the Z=0 plane) is not chamfered and is intended to be fused to the rest of the component.

### Female
The female thread is designed to a depth of 12mm, with a 2mm thick backstop. The depth is intended to be shallow enough to allow any male thread which follows the specification, and thus is 14.5mm or more in length, to reach the backstop and press the gasket to form an airtight seal.
